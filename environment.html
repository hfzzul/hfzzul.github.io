            The map below displays the top countries involved with Bitcoin mining. Data is displayed by their computational hash rate in percentages after China bans all cryptocurrency transaction and mining. 
            Note that China was involved with more than 75% of the global hash rate before the ban and closing down of mining farms in March 2021. This caused many miners to flee to Kazakhstan and America to continue their endeavours. Below is a map displaying countries hashrate in Jan '22'. As you can see China still has mining operations even after the ban as miners would use VPN spoofing to keep authorities at bay.

            The general worry is the kind of energy that these countries were using to produce the electricity required to power the computers were going to emit excessive amounts of Co2. Kazakhstan use the burning of fossil fuels like coal to power most of their bitcoin mining operation as it is cheaper alternative than renewable energy like hydro-electricity and wind energy. In the end of 2022 the Bitcoin mining industry's sustainable energy mix was estimated to be at 59.4%.

                Rise of Proof of Stake
            </h2>

            <p class="content-4">
                Due to the growing concerns of Bitcoin mining and the Proof of Work consensus algorithm using alot of energy. Many like the famous Elon Musk have growing concerns of greenhouse gas emission and climate change. Ethereum was Proof of Work coin before 15 September 2022 but merged to be a Proof of Stake coin cutting electricity emissions by 99.9%. Proof of stake coins also have faster transfer speeds and also cheaper rates than its Proof of Work competitor.
