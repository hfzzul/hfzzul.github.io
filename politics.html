                    2008 was one of the worst years financially as the world went into recession due to excessive cheap credit and lax lending standards that fueled the housing bubble. When the bubble burst, banks were holding trillions of dollars worth of meaningless mortgages causing the financial sector to crash .
    
                    The value of traditional money began to decrease and the public trust of banks and financial institutions began to waiver. The flaws of of the existing system caused people to look for a better answer, to adopt a decentralised alternative.

                    Fueled by the effects and causation of the 2008 financial crash, Satoshi Nakamoto released Bitcoin to the public striving to show the world that a currency with no reliance to any financial institution is possible. Bitcoin was building back trust within the population with encryption, anonymity and privacy.

                    El-Salvador is the first country to use Bitcoin as legal tender. However due to its volatility, is it really practical? The United Kingdom is also planning to build infrastructure using blockchain for their new “digital pound” concept leveraging low transfer fees and fast peer to peer transaction as the main selling point. This pound however will be tied to the fiat currencies valuation at the moment making it essentially a stable coin.

                    A cashless future could be the making but banks are still skeptical at the idea of using Bitcoin as legal tender thus innovating own technologies that would bring them more control.
