                    Cryptocurrency is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography for secure financial transactions. 
                    It is decentralized, meaning it is not controlled by any government or financial institution. 
                    Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency, was created in 2009. There are now thousands of different cryptocurrencies, all with their own unique features and uses.

                    Cryptocurrencies have no central authority or government body to dictate its price. The value of crypto is made by people agreeing that it is a valuable asset thus driving prices up or down depending on demand and trust. Cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin have a maximum supply causing a big supply & demand trend that is highly volatile.
                    The worldwide trust in blockchain technology and movement is the reason for Bitcoins general success.
                    What if there was a way to discredit and hack alternate coins built on Bitcoins technology?

                    Will trust still be there for investors?
